Invoice

Invoices are generated based on an order, however they're not linked to it, as you can see in the class diagram below:

You can generate an order's invoice from the admin order edit page (a new invoice is generated each time you click on this link). The invoice can also be generated by the customer once the payment is successful, however this link will check for existing invoices with same order reference before trying to generate the invoice.
