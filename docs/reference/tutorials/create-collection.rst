===================
Create a collection
===================

Now that we have our categories, we will add *Spoon* and *Bowl* as collections.

Click on the *Classification* menu and select *Collections* in its sub-menu.

Just like *categories*, click on the ``Add new`` button and fill in the form providing the name and the media.

You are now ready to add your first product prototype!
