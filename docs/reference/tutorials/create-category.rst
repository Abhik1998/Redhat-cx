Create a category
=================

Category
========

Browse the Sonata demo and go to the admin dashboard (/admin/dashboard).
Default login and password are ``admin``/``admin``.

* In the ``Classification`` menu, select ``Categories``,
* On the top right of the page, click on the ``Add new`` button.
* Fill in the form with at least a name and a media.

.. note::

    If you don't specify the ``position`` for a category, categories will be displayed in the order they are created.

We will then create a root category named *Dishes* and enable it.

Sub-category
============

Repeat the process explained below providing the parent category for two sub-categories:

* Bowl
* Spoon

Once again, don't forget to enable them and then check that everything is properly displayed in the frontoffice.
