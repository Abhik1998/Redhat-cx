Create a category
=================

Single category
===============
Browse the Sonata demo and go to the admin dashboard (default accesses are ``admin``/``admin``).

In the ``Classification`` menu, select ``Categories``.

On the top right of the page, click on ``Add new``.

Fill in the form providing, at least, a name. You can also add a picture on the fly. If don't specify the ``position`` field value, categories will be displayed in the order they were created.

We will then create a root category named "Teams" and enable it.

Sub-category
============
Repeat the `Single category`_ process, and provide the parent category for two sub categories : "AFC" and "NFC". In those subcategories, we will create a "New England Patriots" in the "AFC" category, and the "Arizona Cardinals" and the "NFC" one in order to have a three level tree. Once again, don't forget to enable it and then check that everything is properly displayed in the frontend.
